# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction with Python  
A machine learning project that predicts movie ratings based on various features like **genre, director, actors, and votes**. This project includes **data analysis, visualization, and regression modeling**.

---

## **📂 Dataset**  
The dataset used is **IMDb Movies India.csv**, which contains information about movies, including:  
- 🎭 **Genre**  
- 🎬 **Director**  
- 🎭 **Actors** (Lead and supporting actors)  
- ⭐ **Rating** (IMDb rating)  
- 📊 **Votes** (User votes on IMDb)  

---

## **🔧 Installation & Setup**  
To run this project, follow these steps:  


### ** Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install required libraries:  

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn google-colab



## **📊 Features & Visualizations**  
### ✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Handles missing values  
- Converts non-numeric values (like `$5.16M`, `1.2K`) into numbers  
- Standardizes column names  

### ✅ **Visualizations**  
The project generates the following **charts** to analyze movie trends:  
1️⃣ **Histogram** - Distribution of Movie Rating:
2️⃣ **Bar Chart** - Directors & Actors Analysis:  
   - Top **Directors by Average Rating**  
   - Top **Actors by Average Rating**  
   - Top **Directors by Total Votes**  
   - Top **Actors by Total Votes**  

---

## **📌 Usage**  
- **Upload IMDb Movies India.csv** when prompted.  
- Run the script, and it will automatically process the data and generate **insightful charts**.  
- Use the final cleaned dataset for **Machine Learning models** (Regression, Classification).
