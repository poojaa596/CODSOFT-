# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using Python. Through data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning, we uncover insights and create a robust predictive model.

## Overview
The Titanic dataset, a classic in data science, contains details about passengers like age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status. This project:
- Explores data through visualizations.
- Processes missing and categorical data.
- Builds and evaluates a predictive model using Random Forest.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and machine learning.
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
  - Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations.
  - Scikit-learn for preprocessing and modeling.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- **Target**: `Survived` (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).
- **Features**:
  - Passenger details: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`.
  - Family-related: `SibSp`, `Parch`.
  - Other: `Embarked` (port of boarding).

---

## Key Insights
- **Survival by Gender**: Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- **Impact of Class**: Passengers in 1st class had better survival chances.
- **Fare and Age**: Higher fares and certain age groups correlated with increased survival.

---

## Model Performance
- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Classifier.
- **Accuracy Achieved**: [Insert Accuracy Here]%.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab).

---

## Visualizations
The project includes:
- Survival rates by gender and class.
- Age and fare distribution by survival.
- Embarkation port trends.
